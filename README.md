## Contribution Guidelines

- **The first Pull Request (PR) should serve as an outline/template** for future contributions.  
- **Commit messages must be clear and descriptive**, summarizing the key changes made.  
- **PR titles should be short yet informative**, so it's easy to grasp the focus area.  
- **Every PR must include a brief description** of key changes/features implemented.  
- The **PR description helps reviewers understand the scope quickly**, making the review process faster and smoother.  

By following these principles, we keep our repository structured, maintainable, and efficient.

### Commits
Try to *make commits as frequently as possible*, ideally **everytime you have finished a logical unit** (eg.: class, complicated function, part of html template, ...).

#### Types of commit
Here are provided some types of commits:
- **feat:** Introduces a new feature.
- **fix:** Patches a bug.
- docs: Updates or adds documentation.
- **style:** Code style changes (e.g., formatting, missing semi-colons) without affecting functionality.
- **refactor:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- perf: Improvements to performance.
- **test:** Adding or correcting tests.
- build: Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies.
- ci: Updates to CI configuration files and scripts.
- **chore:** Other changes that don't modify src or test files.

However, the most frequently used are the types in **bold** so focus on them.

#### Commit structure
Commit consist of 3 parts:
1. **type** = nature of changes
2. **scope** = affected area, this one is *optional*
3. **description**

and is structured as follows:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

example:
chore(codebase): readme.md outline created
Something similar to *this ‚Üë* should suffice.

### Pull Requests
Pull request naming should follow the same principles as commits, however the **scope is mandatory**.

## .md Styling Rules
Every key concept should be briefly described in wiki (like the structure of Frontend, Backend etc.).
To work in .md seamlessly, the set of some fundamental rules is provided below:

- Use `#` for top-level headings.
- Use `##` for second-level headings.
- Use `###` for third-level headings, and so on.
- Use `**bold**` for bold text.
- Use `*italic*` for italic text.
- Use `-` for bullet points.
- Use `1.` for numbered lists.
- Use backticks for inline code: `` `code` ``.
- Use triple backticks for code blocks:
    ```markdown
    ```
    code block
    ```
    ```
- Use `> ` for blockquotes.
- Use `[text](url)` for links.
- Use `![alt text](image_url)` for images.
